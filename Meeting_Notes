NOTES FROM MEETING:

- Original Sequential Model (DONE)
- Use ResNet CNN in addition to our current model. (Pre-Trained Model for new accuracy to compare to current model!) (Compare Model Accuracy) (DONE)
- Evaluating our 94% model: Collect random 100 fruit images, use Pytorch, make a FastRCNN model, and try to see if our model can recognize it. Use our trained model after for the correct labels.
- Use Clip/PyTorch to evaluate the model (HuggingFace's tokenizers library) 


PROFESSORS CHAT NOTES:
1- ResNet (Described above)  (DONE)
2- What is the 6% error? Qualitative analysis. (For Step 6)
3- Make a Confusion matrix. (For Step 6)
4- Random 100 images (from any resource), Faster-RCNN, do segmentation => do deeper evaluations.  (Described Above) (Step 5)
5- CLIP [from hugging face library] (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clip) (Described Above) (Step 5)
6- Learning Curve (If we want to add more information about the model) (Step 6)
