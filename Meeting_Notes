NOTES FROM MEETING:

- Use ResNet CNN in addition to our current model. (Pre-Trained Model for new accuracy to compare to current model!)
- Evaluating our 94% model: Collect random 100 fruit images, use Pytorch, make a FastRCNN model, and try to see if our model can recognize it. Use our trained model after for the correct labels.
- OR Use Clip/PyTorch to evaluate the model (HuggingFace's tokenizers library)
